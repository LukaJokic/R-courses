Hi, welcome to my introductory course of R programming language.
In this video I will introduce myself and the summary of this course in a few sentences.

My name is Luka and I have been using R for five years now for different purposes, both personal and business.
I have master's in Statistics and Quantitative Finance and work in a bank as a risk modeller.

I will present some basic concepts in R in the next few videos.
This introductory course consists of five videos split by the following steps.

1. Packages.

2. Importing and transforming data.

3. Exploring and summarizing data. 

4. Visualization.

5. Saving results.


In the first video, I talk about some fundamental group of packages I use for each project.
I do not show how to download and install R and R studio as there are million videos that explain that thoroughly.
In this video you will see how to install and load packages and find out which are main functions in each package.

In the second video I concentrate on importing the data from different sources.
In addition, I show how to convert and transform the data so that it is suitable for succeeding analyses.

Third video is about exploring and summarizing data, finding valuable patterns as well as introducing various aggregate functions.

The next step is presenting results graphically using R visualization functions which is shown in the fourth video.

In the last video, I explain how to save results.

I hope this is going to be interesting and educative journey!
Thank you and enjoy!
