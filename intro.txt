Hi, welcome to my introductory course of R programming language.
In this video I will first introduce myself in a few sentences and present the summary of this course.
My name is Luka and I will introduce some basic concepts in R in the next few videos.
I have been using R for five years now for different purposes, both personal and business.

The introductory course consists of five videos split by the following steps.

1. Packages.

2. Importing and transforming data.

3. Exploring and summarizing data. 

4. Visualization.

5. Saving results.


In the first video, I talk about some fundamental group of packages I use for each project.
I do not show how to download and install R and R studio as there are million videos that explain that thoroughly.
In this video you will see how to install and load packages and find out which are main functions from each package.

In the second video I concentrate on import of data from different sources.
In addition, I show how to convert and transform data so that it is suitable for succeeding analyses.

Third video is about exploring and summarizing data, finding valuable patterns from data as well as presenting various aggregate functions.

After data is ready, the next step is presenting it graphically using R visualization functions which is shown in the fourth video.

In the last video, I explain how to save results.

I hope this is going to be interesting and educative journey!
Thank you and enjoy!
